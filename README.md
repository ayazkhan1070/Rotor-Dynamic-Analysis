# Rotor-Dynamic-Analysis
1. Ansys modeling of all the three types of rotors i.e. single, double, and triple rotor and analyze it on various aspects like material selection, geometry, etc.
2. Analyze all three rotors on different parameters like rotating velocities, material durability, and temperature.
3. Also check for the rotor’s durability by taking different materials and getting adeeper understanding of material selection.
4. Analyze the rotor at different geometry by varying the geometry of its shaft and blades and get a deeper understanding of the geometry of mechanical devices
